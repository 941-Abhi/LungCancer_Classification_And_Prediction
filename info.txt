We've used several key Python libraries for your lung cancer classification project. Here's a summary of the libraries and their purpose:

For Machine Learning and Deep Learning
TensorFlow: The primary open-source platform for machine learning.

Keras: A high-level API that simplifies building and training deep learning models. It runs on top of TensorFlow.

Scikit-learn: A popular library for traditional machine learning tasks. We used it for model evaluation metrics like the confusion matrix and classification report.

For Data Handling and Visualization
NumPy: The fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It's used to work with arrays and matrices, which are how images are represented.

Matplotlib: A plotting library used to create charts and graphs, such as the bar chart for class distribution and plots for model history.

Pillow (PIL): An image processing library. We used it to open, handle, and manipulate image files.

OpenCV: A computer vision library used for more advanced image processing tasks.

For System Operations
os: A built-in Python module for interacting with the operating system. We used it to manage file paths and directories for your dataset.

Random: A built-in Python module for generating random numbers. We used it for randomly sampling images.

Found 613 images belonging to 4 classes.
Found 72 images belonging to 4 classes.
Found 315 images belonging to 4 classes.


Descriptive analysis:
1. Class Distribution Analysis : This script will count the images in each class and then visualize the results with a bar chart

2. Image-Specific Analysis :  
 2.1 Image Dimensions and Distribution
 This code checks all images in your training set to see if they are the same size. If they're not, it will show you the distribution of different image sizes.
 2.2 Average Image and Pixel-Level Analysis
 This code calculates the average image for each class and also generates a pixel intensity histogram to check for consistent brightness.

3. Data Quality and Inspection : the code for the "Data Quality and Inspection" analysis you described. This script covers visual inspection, checking for duplicates, and finding potential outliers.
 3.1 Visual Inspection :  randomly samples and displays a few images from each class. This is a great way to manually spot mislabeled or corrupted images.
 3.2  Duplicate Images : To check for duplicates, you'll use an image hashing technique. First, you need to install the imagehash library. Open your Anaconda Prompt and run: pip install imagehash.
3.3  Outlier Plot : 
This code identifies potential outliers by calculating the average pixel intensity (brightness) of all images and flagging those that are significantly brighter or darker than the average.
